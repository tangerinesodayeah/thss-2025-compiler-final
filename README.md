Framework code for the 2025 Assembly and Compilation Principles course(44100593) project at Tsinghua University.

## Prerequisites

Before building the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed on your system:

**Ubuntu/Debian**

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential cmake git pkg-config python3 openjdk-11-jdk curl clang
```

### Build and Run

1. Generate ANTLR Files

    ```bash
    make antlr
    ```

2. Configure and Build the Project
   
    ```bash
    mkdir build && cd build
    cmake ..
    make -j8
    ```

### Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```

### Package ans Submit

```bash
python package.py
```

### IRBuilder
For Testing The IRBuilder (8 could be replaced with a higher number depending on your CPU cores): 

```bash     
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . -j8
./ir_test
```

Note that when using the IRBuilder, you should ensure that all virtual registers (starting with `%`) have unique names to avoid conflicts in the generated LLVM IR. (Already implemeted a renaming mechanism in IRBuilder)
